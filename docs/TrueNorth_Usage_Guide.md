# TrueNorth – End-to-End Usage Guide (Example Driven)

This guide explains **exactly how a real user uses TrueNorth**, from first launch to daily execution, using concrete examples and explicit rules.

---

## Mental Model

TrueNorth separates **thinking from doing**.

- Evenings are for decisions
- Mornings are for execution
- Goals provide direction, tasks provide movement

---

# PART 1 – INITIAL SETUP (ONCE PER QUARTER)

## Step 1: Define North Stars (Life Areas)

**What they are:** Stable life domains, not goals.

**Examples:**

- Work
- Family
- Health
- YouTube

**Rule:** 4–6 max.

---

## Step 2: Set Quarterly Polaris Goals

**What they are:** Directional outcomes, not task lists.

**Examples:**

- Work: *Become a high-impact, trusted engineer*
- Family: *Be present and supportive during baby’s first months*
- Health: *Build a sustainable strength habit*
- YouTube: *Launch and publish consistently*

---

# PART 2 – MONTHLY MISSIONS (BEGINNING OF MONTH)

## What a Monthly Mission Is

A **theme**, not a checklist.

**Example:**

- Work (April): *Improve test reliability and speed*
- YouTube (April): *Define channel identity and workflow*

---

# PART 3 – WEEKLY FLOW (WEEKEND)

## Weekly Review

Answer:

- What moved me forward?
- What drifted?
- What needs adjustment?

No judgment.

---

## Weekly Headings

**Rule:** 1–3 max.

**Examples:**

- Improve flaky test suite
- Publish 2 YouTube videos

---

## Populate "This Week" (Kanban)

Pull tasks from:

- Horizon (Inbox)

Do **not** assign days yet.

# PART 4 – DAILY FLOW

## Evening: Prepare Tomorrow (Critical Habit)

### Step 1: Clear Horizon

- Process new ideas, requests, interruptions

### Step 2: Choose Tomorrow’s True Step

No prioritization unless life forces it.
